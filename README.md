# sign-up-form

A mock website for signing up for art classes that I provided when I was an art teacher

The image on the website is a watercolor piece that I did in 2019

The part that gave me the greatest difficulty was in placing the image in the background on the left and keeping the original aspect ratio. I fixed it by placing the image through css instead of through html.

Javascript shall be added later as practice, or if I choose to reactivate my teaching classes.
